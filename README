This is a version of polipo that is used in my TetherUnblocked tether unblocking app for Android.
It has very little changes, and at this time only has an additional configuration parameter to add
a custom User-Agent to feign in all outgoing requests.

Any other changes will be viewable by the history.

Polipo README

very modest resource needs.  See the file INSTALL for installation
instructions.  See the texinfo manual (available as HTML after
installation) for more information.
